- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [ ] Clarify Project Requirements

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete

Clarified Project Requirements (summary):
- Flask modular app with blueprints: auth, admin, planning, media, utility.
- Persistence via SQLAlchemy + Alembic; avoid ad-hoc schema mutation.
- Planning domain (critical path, dependencies, drafts, reorder, exports) pending full migration into `planning` blueprint (currently minimal index only).
- Presence tracking endpoint (`/active_users`) now in `utility` blueprint.
- Media blueprint manages multi-association images.

Implementation Progress:
- [x] Verify file exists
- [ ] Clarify Project Requirements (expand into developer docs / README architecture section)
- [ ] Scaffold the Project (VS Code tasks/launch added, pending checkbox update after verification)
- [ ] Customize the Project (restore planning advanced endpoints)
- [ ] Install Required Extensions (Python, Pylance â€“ installation scripted)
- [ ] Compile the Project (Python compileall + basic run task)
- [ ] Create and Run Task (tasks.json: run / upgrade; launch.json for debugger)
- [ ] Launch the Project (verify dev server boots with new structure)
- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete (augment README with architecture & workflow)

Work through each checklist item systematically.
Keep communication concise and focused.
Follow development best practices.
