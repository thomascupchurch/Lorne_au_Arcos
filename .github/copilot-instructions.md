Clarified Project Requirements (summary):
- Flask modular app with blueprints: auth, admin, planning, media, utility.
- Persistence via SQLAlchemy + Alembic; avoid ad-hoc schema mutation.
- Planning domain (critical path, dependencies, drafts, reorder, exports) pending full migration into `planning` blueprint (currently minimal index only).
- Presence tracking endpoint (`/active_users`) now in `utility` blueprint.
- Media blueprint manages multi-association images.

Implementation Progress:
- [x] Verify file exists
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (added summary below; will expand README next)
- [x] Scaffold the Project (VS Code tasks/launch added)
- [ ] Customize the Project (restore planning advanced endpoints)
- [x] Install Required Extensions (Python, Pylance recommendations)
- [x] Compile the Project (Compile task added)
- [x] Create and Run Task (upgrade/run tasks + debugger)
- [x] Launch the Project (launch config added)
- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete (augment README with architecture & workflow)

Work through each checklist item systematically.
Keep communication concise and focused.
Follow development best practices.
